                <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
                <p>
                    HTML stands for <b>HyperText Markup Language</b>. <br>
                    It is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.
                    It can be assisted by technologies such as <b>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</b> and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

                <h3>HTML Elements</h3>
                <p>
                    An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag:
                    <code>
                        &lt;element&gt;content&lt;/element&gt;
                    </code>
                    
                    Some HTML elements have empty content, and they do not need an end tag. These are called self-closing tags:
                    <code>
                        &lt;element&gt;
                    </code>
                </p>
            </section>

                <h3>HTML Attributes</h3>
                <p>
                    HTML elements can have attributes. Attributes provide additional information about an element. Attributes are always specified in the start tag. Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value".
                    <code>&lt;element attribute="value"&gt;content&lt;/element&gt;</code>
                </p>

                <h3>History of the World Wide Web</h3>
                <p>
                    The World Wide Web was invented in 1989 by <b>Tim Berners-Lee</b>.<br>
                    He wrote the first web browser in 1990 while <b>employed at CERN</b> near Geneva, Switzerland.<br>
                    The browser was released outside CERN in 1991, first to other research institutions starting in January 1991 and to the general public on the Internet in August 1991.

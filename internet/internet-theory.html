                <h3>History of the World Wide Web</h3>
                <p>
                    The World Wide Web was invented in 1989 by <b>Tim Berners-Lee</b>.<br>
                    He wrote the first web browser in 1990 while <b>employed at CERN</b> near Geneva, Switzerland.<br>
                    The browser was released outside CERN in 1991, first to other research institutions starting in January 1991 and to the general public on the Internet in August 1991.

                <h3>General introduction to URL</h3>
                <p>
                    A <b>uniform resource locator</b> (URL) is a reference to a resource on the Web that specifies its location and a mechanism for retrieving it.<br>
                    URLs are commonly used to reference web pages (HTTP/HTTPS), but also for file transfer (FTP), email (mailto), and other applications. <br>
                    <b>A typical URL includes a protocol, a hostname, and a file name. </b>
                </p>

                <h3>URL Syntax</h3>
                <p>
                    A URL is composed of several parts, each of which has its own meaning and purpose.<br>
                    The syntax of a URL is as follows:<br>
                    <code>
                        protocol://hostname:port/path/filename
                    </code>
                    <img src="images/URI_syntax.jpg" alt="URL Syntax">

                    <b>Fragment</b> identifiers are used to <b>identify a portion</b> of a document, and <b>query</b> strings are used <b>to pass data</b> to the server.<br>

                    Example: <code>http://www.example.com/index.html?name=John#section1</code>
